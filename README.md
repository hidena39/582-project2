## Project's title

Shopping List

## About Me

I am a web design student.

## About this app

This app is made to learn the framework Vue.JS using Pinia, and MongoDB using node.js.

This is an app for a family to share a shopping list. Admin(such as parents) can add, and delete items. Users(such as kids) can only mark the list as purchased. This will prevent the kids from adding unnecessary items to the list, or deleting unwanted items from the list. But parents can still ask kids to help with the shopping.

There are

- Admin function: Add and delete stores from the database
- Admin function: Add and delete items from the database
- All users: View the list
- All users: Mark items as purchased and add the purchased date in the database
- In the list page, users can see the storename in the url
